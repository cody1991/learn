There’s a common application pattern: create, read, update, and delete. It’s shortened to CRUD, which is a fun word

Lots of applications use CRUD. For example, imagine a photo-sharing app that has
no user accounts; anyone can upload photos. Here’s how you might envision that in
CRUD style:
■ Users can upload photos; this is the create step.
■ Users can browse photos; this is the read part.
■ Users can update photos, perhaps by giving them different filters or changing
captions; this would be an update.
■ Users can delete photos from the website. This would be, well, a delete.
